# Admin-Dashboard

One of the only main criteria for this poject was to design a site similar to the template using *grid* with the styling and layout of the page.

The page template is as follows below:

***My Project:***


* **Design**

We were given a lot of freedom to design the page how we wanted. Upon looking at this, it made me think of something for a project manager for construction. I wanted to do something different, so I designed it with Bob the Builder. That was the first thing that came to mind, so I thought I could add some humor into the page, along with some easter eggs. I wanted to set up the page similarly to the template so I had something to go off of. I also thought it needed something more and looked a little crouded for a page. I added in a collapse button for the side menu to add some depth to the page and give the option to make it look a little cleaner.

* **Challenges**

The only realy challenge of this was working with *grid*. Doing it outside of practice on a much larger scale make it much more complicated because you have to plot out the layout beforehand to save yourself from going back and adjusting everything again. The other challenge was just adding the small details within the page. All the SVGs, images, size adjustments for specific objects, and cursor changes on hover just takes a little more time to make sure the site looks and feels like a real site should.
